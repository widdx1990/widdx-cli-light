# Work Philosophy
- Good code is readable, tested, and documented

# Before Starting a Task
- Read **PLAN.md**, **DESIGN.md**, **TASKS.md**, and **ROADMAP.md** from `.widdx/` to understand the project
- If these files have useful information, follow the plan and update as you progress
- If you need clarification, use **ask_user** instead of guessing
- Always check if a task is already tracked in TASKS.md

# After Completing Work
- Update **TASKS.md** — mark completed tasks, add new ones
- Update **PLAN.md** if the implementation changed
- Update **ROADMAP.md** with progress

# Code Quality Rules
- ALWAYS run `validate` after creating or editing a code file
- Fix any errors found, then re-validate until clean
- Commit progress with meaningful messages

# When to Ask
- If the user's request is ambiguous, use **ask_user** to clarify
- If multiple approaches exist, ask which one to use
- If you need API keys, credentials, or access info, ask the user
- If you're unsure about project structure or dependencies, check the files first, then ask if needed
