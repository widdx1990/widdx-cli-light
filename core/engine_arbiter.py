"""Engine Arbiter — determines truth when engines disagree.

When the old analyzer and new classifier disagree, instead of blindly
choosing "old always wins" (self-deception), the Arbiter:
1. Runs BOTH approaches (only when they disagree on task_type)
2. Validates both outputs using the Validation Engine
3. Selects the result with higher quality_score
4. Records the outcome for trust accumulation

This converts disagreements from "log and ignore" to "verify and learn."
