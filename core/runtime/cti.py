"""Constraint Transparency Index (CTI) — measures learning potential lost to constraints.

Answers: "How much learning that should have happened, didn't happen
because of the constraints?"

Core metrics:
  CTI           — ratio of blocked learning to total potential learning (0=transparent, 1=opaque)
  Information Loss — cumulative knowledge lost per constraint
  Visibility Index — what % of the learning landscape is visible to the system
  Learning Freedom — inverse of total constraint suppression
